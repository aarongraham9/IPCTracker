My guess is that Apple doesn't want you using it anymore.

The officially sanctioned way is now the iconsutil command instead.

From Apple's guidelines:

After youâ€™ve created the necessary app icon assets, place them in folder a named icon.iconset. To create an .icns file, use iconutil in Terminal. Terminal is located in /Applications/Utilities/Terminal. Enter the command iconutil -c icns <iconset filename>, where <iconset filename> is the path to the .iconset folder. You must use iconutil, not Icon Composer, to create high-resolution .icns files.

There's another relevant Apple doc that goes more in depth: High Resolution Resources.

For reference, the complete set of icons:

icon_16x16.png
icon_16x16@2x.png
icon_32x32.png
icon_32x32@2x.png
icon_128x128.png
icon_128x128@2x.png
icon_256x256.png
icon_256x256@2x.png
icon_512x512.png
icon_512x512@2x.png
Note the last one is the equivalent of 1024x1024, though it seems like iconutil wants it named 512x512@2x, at least in Lion.

Note that you shouldn't have a 64x64 version of th eimage or errors will be abound.
